## ðŸ”„ **Scrambler**
A Scrambler is a method in communication systems to modify data before transmission, introducing a controlled level of randomness to the bit patterns. Its purpose is to reduce predictable sequences in the data stream, which helps to prevent issues like electromagnetic interference (EMI) and signal distortion   Scramblers are used in many communicaton protocols such as PCI Express, SAS/SATA, USB, Bluetooth, etc.
